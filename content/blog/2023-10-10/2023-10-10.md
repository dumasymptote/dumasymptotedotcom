I DID IT! {.underline .text-2xl .font-bold}

I felt real bad after leaving the bar on that second day. But goes to show I still don't know shit about shit especially whether I did well on something or not.

I passed the UBE with a 337, so I can practice in any state that accepts the UBE if I transfer my score!

Currently happy to just be licensed in Texas but may expand to other states depending on what the firm needs.

Here is my bar page
