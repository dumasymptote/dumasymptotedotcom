Back to the Grind.

Honestly, I am exhausted. Why? No idea.

I am trying to figure out what the future holds for me.

I am thinking of writing a short story based off of some dreams I had this weekend. Maybe I will get to that at some point. If I do I will probably put it here so that no one will ever read it. :)
