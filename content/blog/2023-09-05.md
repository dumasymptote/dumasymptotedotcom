### More waiting on the horizon {.font-bold .text-xl .text-blue-400}

We took the bar at the end of july, made it all the way through August, still have all of September and half of October to go before results though. I usually don't worry about the outcome of tests, either I passed or I have to do better on the next one. However, this one is kind of a big deal. Not that failing would be the end of the world, but I have talked a whole lot of shit the last 4 years it sure would be sad to fail :).

### Class Ranks {.text-xl .text-blue-400}

So UNTD sent out notifications that the class ranks for our graduating class were final. I ended up 6/94. I was hoping to sneak into the top 5% but either way I'll take it. Class ranks mean less than nothing either way.
