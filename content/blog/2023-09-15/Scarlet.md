### HAPPY BIRTHDAY {.text-xl .font-semibold .text-red-800}

GROOBERT IS OFFICIALLY 12! TIME FOR A RETROSPECTIVE!

-  Age 0 {.text-xl .font-semibold .text-red-800}

We have a baby groob first off. Notice how she is already mad at me and hasnt been out of the womb more than 2 months at this point. {.pb-4 }

- Age 1 {.text-xl .font-semibold .text-red-800}

A year in and she seem to have grown some. Still no hair though! { .pb-4 }

{% image "./Scarlet_1.jpg", "1 y/o Groob.", ["500em"] %}

- Age 2 {.text-xl .font-semibold .text-red-800}

Didn't take her long to discover her love for candy. I am pretty sure this is her eating a whole handful of gummy worms. { .pb-4 }

{% image "./Scarlet_2.jpg", "2 y/o Groob.", ["500em"] %}

- Age 3 {.text-xl .font-semibold .text-red-800}

Like father like daughter. Goofy faces and all. Notice that she finally found some hair! { .pb-4 }

- Age 4 {.text-xl .font-semibold .text-red-800}

My little girl in her lady bug outfit! { .pb-4 }

- Age 5 {.text-xl .font-semibold .text-red-800}

5 years old and jamie is already dressing her like a cross between a nerd and a mormon housewife. { .pb-4 }

- Age 6 {.text-xl .font-semibold .text-red-800}

I think this may have been her and Jamie's first year at St. Stephen. { .pb-4 }

{% image "./Scarlet_6.jpg", "6 y/o Groob.", ["500em"] %}

- Age 7 {.text-xl .font-semibold .text-red-800}

Sloths and a donut. I don't think I could have described her better myself. { .pb-4 }

{% image "./Scarlet_7.jpg", "7 y/o Groob.", ["500em"] %}

- Age 8 {.text-xl .font-semibold .text-red-800}

Ah one of the several times she broke her arm, this time from ice skating! She is enjoying her bubbly drink from magic time machine here. { .pb-4 }

{% image "./Scarlet_8.jpg", "8 y/o Groob.", ["500em"] %}

OH HO A SECOND ONE. This time she is roasting me! She wanted to be a lawyer with the same attitude as her daddy, hence the annoyed look on her face! { .pb-4 }

{% image "./Scarlet_8_2.jpg", "8 y/o pt 2 electric groobaloo.", ["500em"] %}

- Age 9 {.text-xl .font-semibold .text-red-800}

A trip to the zoo during covid! She was probably tired of being home with me here. Also she got to meet her animal spirit, the sloth. { .pb-4 }

{% image "./Scarlet_9.jpg", "9 y/o Groob.", ["500em"] %}

- Age 10 {.text-xl .font-semibold .text-red-800}

Look at my kid the rebel! I love her hair in this! the fact that she had the courage to do this is awesome! { .pb-4 }

{% image "./Scarlet_10.jpg", "10 y/o Groob.", ["500em"] %}

- Age 11 {.text-xl .font-semibold .text-red-800}

Groob and her best friend at the football game shortly after her 11th birthday. She is already sick of me but couldnt help but pose for the photo. { .pb-4 }

{% image "./Scarlet_11.jpg", "11 y/o Groob.", ["500em"] %}

- Age 12 {.text-xl .font-semibold .text-red-800}

Here she is a week before her birthday this time. I wanted to have this ready for her birthday so I didnt want to wait for an official 12y/o picture. As much of a pain in the butt as she can be, I can't imagine having a better kid. I love you groob. Happy birthday! { .pb-4 }
