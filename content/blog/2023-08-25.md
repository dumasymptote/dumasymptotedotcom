## Adverse Possession is a weird concept.

I was talking to J last night about adverse possession. She is ardently against the idea. I absolutely understand her position and it makes sense. If you want your land to be unused and you leave it unused, it should theoretically stay that way.

But here comes adverse possession. Oh you didn't stop this dude from using the land that you owned for 10 years? *Sucks to suck*, its not your land anymore!

I understand the ideas behind the concept but they don't make it feel any less...sleezy?

Oh well.
