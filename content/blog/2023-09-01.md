### A whole month has passed. {.text-xl .text-blue-400}

Its been a whole month since I was hired as a lawyer. This is certainly a very different world than I am used to, not necessarily in a bad way. Different is tough sometimes though. I miss my old co-workers for sure. They were really some of the best dudes you could work with/for. Once I figure out how to make that lawyer money, I am going to take them to lunch somewhere!
