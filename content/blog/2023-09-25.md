Another week goes by and I am still here. The bar hasn't released results yet which is disappointing but what can you do.

I got to watch the first 2 mighty ducks with mi esposa this weekend which was fun. She had never seen them before!

##### Politics
The government is most likely going to shut down which is a travesty.
Both parties need to get their shit together and make some damn compromises.
It is their damn job to help run this country after all.
It is tough to have faith in our elected representatives when they do their best to continually fuck everything up.
Speaking of fuck ups, Ken Paxton was "acquitted" from the impeachment charges.
Another example of party over people.
The evidence clearly showed that Paxton was guilty but the senators didn't want to be primaried.
I honestly don't care if he had a mistress, even though its shitty, but using public office for private gain is unacceptable.
