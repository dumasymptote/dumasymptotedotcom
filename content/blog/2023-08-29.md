### What should I do?

In true me fashion I can't decide something. Over the course of last year I started learning Japanese and while its an awesome language, I can't find the motivation to continue.

I was thinking of starting another language, spanish being the most obvious. I want to learn spanish but then again I would like to learn something crazier, like korean.

Which will I choose? Can I do both? Find out in the next episode of Dragon Ball Z!
