### September = busy{.text-xl .text-slate-700 .pt-5}

I started a post grad attorney position in August. It is pretty stressful realizing that almost everything you learned in law school is useless. The bar has a ton of law that you just didn't have the time or bandwidth to learn initially, and then you get into practice and it turns out your state does things very differently from the federal "standard" you learned for the ube.

### City Council {.text-xl .text-slate-700 .pt-5}

Yesterday I got to sit in on a Greenville City Council meeting. It was interesting. The council voted to approve an ordinance that I had worked on which is kinda cool. I was hoping for some Parks and Rec level shenanigans but there really wasn't any. Oh well.

### Kid{.text-xl .text-slate-700 .pt-5}

My kids birthday is coming up soon. She has been having a tough go of it lately. Growing up is tough and everyone has trouble with it. But she is awesome and I hope she realizes that.
